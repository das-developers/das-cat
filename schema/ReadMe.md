# Federated Das Catalog Node Schemas

The federated das catalog provides clients with the means to locate datasets
in independly of explicit URLs.  In this way it's similar to DOI's, but works
even for datasets that will not be archived.

Each catalog node has a data type string that defines it's encoding, it's 
syntax and it's semantic content.  Catalogs can point to nodes outside the
das ecosystem.  The schema for such nodes would be defined by thier respective
holders.  For das nodes, the schemas are defined here.
