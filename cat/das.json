  "description": "The das2 URIs denote paths in a federated catalog that may have nodes leading to many different organizations and servers. Paths start with the Scheme URI, followed by the ROOT designator and then a posix style path that leads to a node. Sub-node information (infact individual keys) can be indicated by adding a FRAGMENT separator and then the path to the designated object. Each root defines an organizational scheme. At present only the 'site:' root designator is used. Unlike VOTable objects and HAPI nodes, Das2 Catalogs do not provide details of the internals of each dataset.",
