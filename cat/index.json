According to RFC 3986 strings starting with \"pds:\", \"spase:\", \"vap+\", \"das:\" etc. are niether URIs nor URNs as these have not been registered in accordance with RFC 7595 or RFC 8254. This is easy to fix, all that's required is to prefix these schemes with any valid tag URI. Since it seems presumuous to use tag:das2.org,2012: for items that are clearly owned by others, this root catalog contains a global list of URI prefixes to be used a seed paths.",
